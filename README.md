I have completed my first coding project. It contains source code. It is the word and number guessing game using Python. 


It takes the user's name and game preferences. 
The player gets to choose whether he wants to play number-guessing game or word-guessing game. 
In the number guessing game, the user gets to enter the number range he wants and also the level of difficulty- easy and hard, which further decides the number of attempts allowed.
In the word guessing game, the user gets to choose the level of difficulty, which further decides the difficulty of the words by both the length and lexicon. 
There are 40 words with an easy and hard level of difficulty thus making the probability of the occurrence of the same words less. 
Here, the number of attempts will be the same for easy and hard levels. 
All these instructions are given to the user as he makes his choice.
